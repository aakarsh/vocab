          addle egg (mid-13c.) "egg
          that does not hatch, rotten egg," lit. "urine egg," a

<etymology>
            mid-14c., from O.Fr. alchimie (14c.), alquemie (13c.), from M.L. alkimia, from Arabic al-kimiya, from Gk. khemeioa (found c.300 C.E. in a
            decree of Diocletian against "the old writings of the
            Egyptians"), all meaning "alchemy." Perhaps from an old
            name for Egypt (Khemia,
            lit. "land of black earth," found in Plutarch), or from
            Gk. khymatos "that which
            is poured out," from khein
            "to pour," related to khymos "juice, sap" [Klein,
            citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The
            word seems to have elements of both origins.

            
              Mahn ... concludes, after an elaborate investigation,
              that Gr. khymeia was
              probably the original, being first applied to
              pharmaceutical chemistry, which was chiefly concerned
              with juices or infusions of plants; that the pursuits
              of the Alexandrian alchemists were a subsequent
              development of chemical study, and that the notoriety
              of these may have caused the name of the art to be
              popularly associated with the ancient name of Egypt.
              [OED]
            
            The al- is the Arabic
            definite article, "the." The art and the name were
            adopted by the Arabs from Alexandrians and thence
            returned to Europe via Spain. Alchemy was the
            "chemistry" of the Middle Ages and early modern times;
            since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to
            the pursuit of the transmutation of baser metals into
            gold, which, along with the search for the universal
            solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of
            early chemistry.

              activity, bringing with it its wars and its domestic
              struggles for power, its palace revolutions which
              only replace one tyrant by another, and inevitably at
              the end of this development there is ... death! Or
              the destruction of States, and new life starting
              again in thousands of centers on the principle of the

<word>anathema</word>	
<etymology>1520s, "an accursed thing," from L.
          anathema "an excommunicated
          person; the curse of excommunication," from Gk. anathema "a thing accursed,"
          originally "a thing devoted," lit. "a thing set up (to
          the gods)," from ana- "up"
          (see ana-) + tithenai "to place," from PIE base
          *dhe- "to put, to do" (see
          factitious). Originally simply
          a votive offering, by the time it reached Latin the
          meaning had progressed through "thing devoted to evil,"
          to "thing accursed or damned." Later applied to persons
          and the Divine Curse. Meaning "formal act or formula of
          consigning to damnation" is from 1610s.

<word>anchor</word>	
<etymology>
            O.E. ancor, borrowed 9c.

            borrowing and said to be the only Latin nautical term
            used in the Germanic languages. The -ch- form emerged late 16c., a
            pedantic imitation of a corrupt spelling of the Latin
            word. The figurative sense of "that which gives
            stability or security" is from late 14c. Meaning "host
            or presenter of a TV or radio program" is from 1965,
            short for anchorman
            (1958), which earlier meant "the last man of a
            tug-of-war team" (1909) and "the one who runs last in a
            relay race" (1934). 

            
              Anchors are of various sizes. The largest is the
              SHEET-anchor; next in size are the BOWER-anchors,
              hung in the bows of ships; the smallest is the

          Procopius' 6c. Anecdota,
          unpublished memoirs of Emperor Justinian full of court
          gossip, gave the word a sense of "revelation of secrets,"

<etymology>O.E. apa "ape, monkey," from P.Gmc.
          *apan (cf. O.S. apo, O.N. api, Du. aap, Ger. affe), perhaps borrowed in
          Proto-Germanic from Celtic (cf. O.Ir. apa) or Slavic (cf. O.Bohemian
          op, Slovak opitza), perhaps ultimately from a
          non-I.E. language. Apes were noted in medieval times for
          mimicry of human action, hence, perhaps, the other
          figurative use of the word, to mean "a fool." To go ape (in emphatic form, go apeshit) "go crazy" is 1955,
          U.S. slang. To lead apes in

          tip of anything" (one of the meanings in Latin was "small
          rod at the top of the flamen's cap"), from PIE *ap- "to take, reach." Proper
          plural is apices.
</etymology>

          especially as result of brain injury or disorder, 1867,
          from Mod.L. aphasia, from

          "speechlessness," from a-
          "without" (see a- (3)) + phasis "utterance," from phanai "to speak," related to
          pheme "voice, report, rumor"
          (see fame).

</etymology>
<word>apocryphal</word>

<word>apothecary</word>	
<etymology>mid-14c., "shopkeeper, especially
          one who stores, compounds, and sells medicaments," from
          O.Fr. apotecaire (13c.,
          Mod.Fr. apothicaire), from
          L.L. apothecarius
          "storekeeper," from L. apotheca "storehouse," from Gk.
          apotheke "barn, storehouse,"
          lit. "a place where things are put away," from apo- "away" (see apo-) + tithenai "to put," from PIE base
          *dhe- "to put, to do" (see
          factitious). Cognate compounds
          produced Skt. apadha-
          "concealment," O.Pers. apadana- "palace." Drugs and herbs
          being among the chief items of non-perishable goods, the
          meaning narrowed 17c. to "druggist" (Apothecaries'
          Company of London separated from the Grocers' in 1617).
          Same root produced Fr. boutique and Sp. bodega.
          
          Apothecaries formerly were notorious for "the assumed
          gravity and affectation of knowledge generally put on by
          the gentlemen of this profession, who are commonly as
          superficial in their learning as they are pedantic in
          their language" [Francis Grose, "A Classical Dictionary
          of the Vulgar Tongue," 1796]. Hence, Apothecary's Latin, barbarously
          mangled, also known as Dog
          Latin.
</etymology>
<word>apothegm</word>	
<etymology>"pithy saying," 1550s, from Gk.

          opinion plainly," from apo-
          "from" (see apo-) + phthengesthai "to utter." See
          aphorism for nuances of
          usage. Spelling apophthegm,
          restored by Johnson, is preferred in England, according
          to OED.
</etymology>
<word>apotheosis</word>	
<etymology>1600s, from L.L. apotheosis "deification," from Gk.

          noun of action from pp. stem of apparere "appear" (see appear). Meaning "ghost" first
          recorded c.1600; the shade of sense differentiation
          between appearance and apparition is that the latter
          tends to be unexpected or startling.
</etymology>
<word>appease</word>	
<etymology>c.1300 "to reconcile," from

          prehendere "to seize" (see

          extension to "seize with the mind" took place in Latin,
          and was the sole sense of cognate O.Fr. aprendre (Mod.Fr. apprendre "to learn, to be
          informed about;" also cf. apprentice). Original sense
          returned in English in meaning "to seize in the name of

          discretion," from O.Fr. arbitraire (14c.) or directly from
          L. arbitrarius "depending on
          the will, uncertain," from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning
          gradually descended to "capricious" and "despotic"
          (1640s). Related: Arbitrarily; arbitrariness.
</etymology>
<word>arbitrate</word>	
<etymology>1580s (arbitrable is recorded from
          1530s), "to give an authoritative decision," from L.
          arbitratus, pp. of arbitrari "be of an opinion, give
          a decision," from arbiter
          (see arbiter). Meaning "to act as
          an arbitrator" is from 1610s. Related: Arbitrated; arbitrating. An earlier verb form
          was arbitren (early
          15c.).
</etymology>
<word>archaic</word>	
<etymology>1832, originally of words no longer
          in use, from or by influence of Fr. archaique (1776), ultimately from
          Gk. arkhaikos
          "old-fashioned," from arkhaios "ancient," from arkhe "beginning" (see archon). Archaical is attested from
          1804.
</etymology>
<word>prototype</word>	
<etymology>c.1600, from Fr. prototype, from M.L. prototypon, from Gk. prototypon "a first or primitive

<word>archipelago</word>	
<etymology>c.1500, from It. arcipelago "the Aegean Sea"
          (13c.), from Gk. arkhipelagos, from arkhi- "chief" (see archon) + pelagos "sea." Aegean Sea being
          full of island chains, the meaning was extended in
          Italian to "any sea studded with islands." Klein, noting
          the absence of arkhipelagos
          in ancient or Medieval Greek (the modern word in Greek is
          borrowed from Italian) believe it is an Italian mistake
          for Aigaion pelagos "Aegean
          Sea" (M.L. Egeopelagus), or
          influenced by that name.
</etymology>
<word>archives</word>	
<etymology>c.1600, from Fr. archif (16c.), from L.L. archivum (sing.), from Gk. ta arkheia "public records," pl.

          "heat, glow; passion" (12c.), from L. ardorem (nom. ardor) "a flame, fire, burning,
          heat;" also of feelings, etc., "eagerness, zeal," from

          Gamillscheg suggests a connection to O.Fr. argoter "to cut off the stubs left
          in pruning," with a connecting sense of "to get a grip
          on." The best English equivalent is perhaps cant. The German equivalent is
          Rotwelsch, lit. "Red Welsh,"
          but the first element may be connected with M.H.G. rot "beggar."

          sense of "government by those who are the best citizens;"

          best-favored by fortune) is from 1570s and became
          paramount 17c. Hence, the meaning "patrician order"
          (1650s). In early use contrasted with monarchy; after French and
          American revolutions, with democracy.

</etymology>
<word>askance</word>	
<etymology>
            1520s, "sideways, asquint," of obscure origin. OED has
            separate listings for askance and obsolete M.E. askance(s) and no indication of
            a connection, but Barnhart and others derive the newer
            word from the older one. The M.E. word, recorded early
            14c. as ase quances and
            found later in Chaucer, meant “in such a way that; even
            as; as if;” and as an adverb “insincerely,
            deceptively.” It has been analyzed as a compound of as and O.Fr. quanses (pronounced “kanses”)
            “how if,” from L. quam
            "how" + si "if." 

            
              The E[nglish] as is,
              accordingly, redundant, and merely added by way of
              partial explanation. The M.E. askances means "as if" in
              other passages, but here means, "as if it were," i.e.
              "possibly," "perhaps"; as said above. Sometimes the
              final s is dropped ....

              Tale,” 1894]

            see OED entry for askance
            (adv.) for discussion of the mysterious ask- word cluster in English.
            Other guesses about the origin of askance include O.Fr. a escone, from pp. of a word for
            "hidden;" It. a scancio
            "obliquely, slantingly;" or that it is a cognate of askew.

          akhos "pain, grief"), from
          base *agh- "to be depressed,
          be afraid" (see ail). Current sense of "dread
          mixed with veneration" is due to biblical use with

          1814.
</etymology>
<word>awl</word>	
<etymology>O.E. 欼/span> "awl, piercer," from P.Gmc.
          *欯 (cf. O.N. alr, Du. aal, M.L.G. al, O.H.G. 䬡, Ger. Ahle), of uncertain origin.
          Earliest references are to piercing of the ears, though

          to other Western European words for stammering and
          prattling (cf. Swedish babbla, O.Fr. babillier) attested from the same
          era, some of which probably were borrowed from others,
          but etymologists cannot now determine which were
          original. Probably imitative of baby-talk, in any case
          (cf. L. babulus "babbler,"
          Gk. barbaros
          "non-Greek-speaking"). "No direct connexion with Babel can be traced; though
          association with that may have affected the senses"

<etymology>late 14c., "to leave an unplowed
          ridge when plowing," from balk (n.). Extended meaning
          "to omit, intentionally neglect" is mid-15c. Most modern
          senses are figurative, from the notion of a balk in the
          fields as a hindrance or obstruction: sense of "stop

<word>ballast</word>	
<etymology>"heavy material used to steady a

          "bare" (see bare; in this case "mere") +
          last "a load, burden," or
          borrowed from identical terms in North Sea Germanic and
          Scandinavian (cf. O.Dan. barlast, 14c.). "Mere" because not
          carried for commercial purposes. Du. balg-last "ballast," lit.
          "belly-load," is a folk-etymology corruption.
</etymology>
<word>balm</word>	
<etymology>early 13c., basme, aromatic substance made
          from resins and oils, from O.Fr. basme (Mod.Fr. baume), from L. balsamum, from Gk. balsamon "balsam," from Heb. basam "spice," related to Aramaic
          busma, Arabic basham "balsam, spice, perfume."
          Spelling refashioned 15c.-16c. on Latin model. Sense of
          "healing or soothing influence" (1540s) is from aromatic
          preparations from balsam (see balsam). Biblical Balm of Gilead, however, began
          with Coverdale; the Hebrew word there is tsori, which was rendered in
          Septuagint and Vulgate as "resin" (Gk. rhetine, L. resina).
</etymology>
<word>bandy</word>	
<etymology>1570s, "to strike back and forth,"
          from M.Fr. bander, from root
          of band (2). The sense apparently
          evolved from "join together to oppose," to opposition
          itself, to "exchanging blows," then metaphorically, to
          volleying in tennis. Bandy
          (n.) was a 17c. Irish game, precursor of field hockey,
          played with curved a stick (also called a bandy), hence bandy-legged (1680s).
</etymology>
<word>bane</word>	
<etymology>O.E. bana "killer, slayer, murderer;
          the devil," from P.Gmc. *banon, cognate with *banja- "wound" (cf. O.Fris. bona "murderer," O.N. bani, O.H.G. bana "murder," O.E. benn "wound," Goth. banja "stroke, wound"), from PIE
          base *gwhen- "to strike,
          kill, wound" (cf. Avestan banta "ill"). Modern sense of
          "that which causes ruin or woe" is from 1570s.

</etymology>
<word>baroque</word>	
<etymology>
            1765, from Fr. baroque
            (15c.) "irregular," from Port. barroco "imperfect pearl," of
            uncertain origin, perhaps related to Sp. berruca "a wart."

            
              This style in decorations got the epithet of Barroque taste, derived from a
              word signifying pearls and teeth of unequal size.
              [Fuseli's translation of Winkelmann, 1765]
            
            Klein suggests the name may be from Italian painter
            Federigo Barocci
            (1528-1612), a founder of the style. How to tell
            baroque from rococo, according to Fowler: "The
            characteristics of baroque are grandeur, pomposity, and
            weight; those of rococo are inconsequence, grace, and
            lightness." But the two terms often used without
            distinction for styles featuring odd and excessive
            ornamentation.

<word>bastion</word>	
<etymology>1560s, from M.Fr. bastillon, dim. of O.Fr. bastille "fortress, tower,

<etymology>see bate (1).
</etymology>
<word>bauble</word>	
<etymology>"showy trinket or ornament," early
          14c., from O.Fr. baubel
          "child's toy, trinket," probably a reduplication of bel, from L. bellus "pretty" (see bene-). Or else related to
          babe, baby.
</etymology>
<word>bawdy</word>	
<etymology>
            late 14c., "soiled, dirty, filthy." Meaning "lewd" is
            from 1510s, from bawd (q.v.), with sense of
            "pertaining to, or befitting a bawd;" usually of
            language (originally to talk
            bawdy). 

            
              Bawdy Basket, the
              twenty-third rank of canters, who carry pins, tape,

<word>beatific</word>	
<etymology>1630s, from Fr. b顴ifique or directly from L.L.

</etymology>
<word>beatitude</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., "supreme happiness,"
          from M.Fr. b顴itude (15c.)
          and directly from L. beatitudinem (nom. beatitudo) "state of blessedness,"
          from pp. stem of beare "make
          happy," related to bene-. As "a declaration of
          blessedness" (usually plural, beatitudes, especially in
          reference to the Sermon on the Mount) it is attested from
          1520s.
</etymology>
<word>bedizen</word>	
<etymology>
            1660s, from be- + dizen "to dress" (1610s),
            especially, from late 18c., "to dress finely, adorn,"
            originally "to dress (a distaff) for spinning" (1520s),
            and evidently the verbal form of the first element in
            distaff. 

            
              It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as
              a separate word, has been found in OE. or ME., and
              that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is known in L.G. or Du.

<word>bedraggle</word>	
<etymology>1727, p.p. adj. from bedraggle.
</etymology>
<word>befuddle</word>	
<etymology>1887, from be- + fuddle. Originally to confuse
          with strong drink. An earlier word in the same sense was
          begunk (1725).
</etymology>
<word>beget</word>	
<etymology>O.E. begietan "to get by effort, find,
          acquire, attain, seize" (class V strong verb, p.t. begeat, pp. begeaton), from be- + get (q.v.). Sense of "to

<word>behemoth</word>	
<etymology>
            late 14c., huge biblical beast (Job xl.15), from L.
            behemoth, from Heb. b'hemoth, usually taken as
            plural of intensity of b'hemah "beast." But the Hebrew
            word is perhaps a folk etymology of Egyptian pehemau, lit. "water-ox," the
            name for the hippopotamus. 

            
              Long before Jumbo was dreamed of, a hippo was
              exhibited by George K. Bailey, who invented the tank
              on wheels now used so generally in the circuses. The
              beast was advertised as "the blood sweating Behemoth
              of Holy Writ," and he made several men rich. [Isaac
              F. Marcosson, "Sawdust and Gold Dust," in "The
              Bookman," June 1910]

<word>beholden</word>	
<etymology>"under obligation," mid-14c.,
          originally pp. of behold (and preserving the
          original pp. of hold), but a sense directly
          related to this usage is not recorded among the many and
          varied meanings attested for behold.
</etymology>
<word>behoove</word>	
<etymology>O.E. behofian "to have need of, have

</etymology>
<word>belabor</word>	
<etymology>c.1600, "to exert one's strength
          upon," from be- + labor (v.). But figurative
          sense of "assail with words" is attested somewhat earlier
          (1590s); and belabored is
          attested from mid-15c. with a sense of "tilled,
          cultivated."
</etymology>
<word>belated</word>	
<etymology>1610s, "overtaken by night," pp.
          adj. from belate "to make
          late, detain," from be- + late. Sense of "coming past
          due, behind date" is from 1660s. Related: Belatedly.
</etymology>
<word>beleaguer</word>	
<etymology>1580s, from Du. or Low Ger. belegeren "to besiege," from be- "around" (see be-) + legeren "to camp," from leger "bed, camp, army, lair,"
          from P.Gmc. *leg-raz-, from
          PIE *legh-to- "lie" (see lie (v.2)). A word from the
          Flemish Wars. Spelling influenced by league. Related: Beleaguered; beleaguering. Cf. Swed. bel䧲a, Du. belegeren "besiege," Ger. Belagerung "siege."
</etymology>
<word>belie</word>	
<etymology>O.E. beleogan "to deceive by lies,"
          from be- + lie (v.1) "to lie, tell lies."
          Current sense of "to contradict as a lie" is first
          recorded 1640s. The other verb lie once also had a formation like
          this, from O.E. belicgan,
          which meant "to encompass, beleaguer," and in M.E. was a
          euphemism for "to have sex with" (i.e. "to lie with
          carnally").
</etymology>
<word>bellicose</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., from L. bellicosus "warlike, valorous,
          given to fighting," from bellicus "of war," from bellum "war," O.L. duellum, dvellum, of uncertain origin.
          Bellona was the name of the

</etymology>
<word>belligerent</word>	
<etymology>1570s, from L. belligerantem (nom. belligerans), pp. of belligerare "to wage war," from
          bellum "war" + gerere "to bear, to carry." The

          Related: Belligerently.
</etymology>
<word>bemoan</word>	
<etymology>O.E. bem殡n "to bemoan, wail, lament;"
          see be- + moan. Related: Bemoaned; bemoaning.
</etymology>
<word>garbled</word>	
<etymology>1570s, of unknown origin; the
          suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from
          Johnson, that it is from Fr. coeur
          mechant "evil heart" is not taken seriously; the
          first syllable may be cur
          "dog." Liberman says the word "must have been borrowed
          from Gaelic (and references muigean "disagreeable person"),
          with variant spelling of intensive prefix ker-. Related: Curmudgeonly.
</etymology>
<word>benediction</word>	
<etymology>c.1400, from L. benedictionem (nom. benedictio), noun of action from
          bene dicere "to speak well
          of, bless," from bene "well"
          (see bene-) + dicere "to speak" (see diction). The oldest sense in
          English is of grace before meat. The older French form,
          benei篮 passed into Middle
          English as benison.
</etymology>
<word>benefactor</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c., from L.L. benefactor, from L. phrase bene facere, from bene "well" (see bene-) + facere "to do" (see factitious). Translated in

<word>beneficial</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c., "helpful, advantageous,"
          from M.Fr. b鮩ficial and
          directly from L. beneficialis "pertaining to a
          favor," from beneficium (see
          benefice).
</etymology>
<word>beneficiary</word>	
<etymology>1610s (n.), 1620s (adj.), probably
          via Fr. b鮩ficiaire, from L.

          benevolentem (nom. benevolens) "wishing (someone)
          well, benevolent," related to benevolentia "good feeling" (see
          benevolence).
</etymology>
<word>benison</word>

<word>bent</word>	
<etymology>"mental inclination," 1570s, from
          bent (adj.) "not straight"
          (q.v.). The verbal meaning "directed in a course" is from
          1690s. Phrase bent out of
          shape "extremely upset" is 1960s U.S. Air Force
          and college student slang.
</etymology>
<word>bequeath</word>	
<etymology>O.E. becwe𡮼/span> "to say, speak to,
          exhort, blame," also "leave by will;" from be- + cwe𡮼/span> "to say," from P.Gmc. *kwithan, from PIE *gwet- "to say, speak." Original
          sense of "say, utter" died out 13c., leaving legal sense
          of "transfer by will." Closely related to bequest. "An old word kept
          alive in wills" [OED 1st ed.]. O.E. beque𥲥 meant "interpreter,
          translator."
</etymology>
<word>berate</word>	
<etymology>1540s, from be- "thoroughly" + M.E. rate "to scold" (late 14c.), from

<word>berserk</word>	
<etymology>
            1844, from berserk (n.)
            "Norse warrior," by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word
            which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from O.N.
            berserkr (n.) "raging
            warrior of superhuman strength;" probably from *ber- "bear" + serkr "shirt," thus lit. "a
            warrior clothed in bearskin." 

            
              Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to
              his edition of the Krisini
              Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk
              frenzy was hamremmi,
              i.e., strength acquired from another strange body,
              because it was anciently believed that the persons
              who were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously
              endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of
              unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was
              called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious
              form, and his ordinary strength alone remained.
              ["Notes and Queries," Dec. 28, 1850]
            
            The adjectival use probably is from such phrases as
            berserk frenzy, or as a
            title (Arngrim the
            Berserk).

<word>beseech</word>	
<etymology>late 12c., bisecen "to beseech, beg

</etymology>
<word>beset</word>	
<etymology>O.E. besettan "to put, place; own,
          keep; occupy, settle; cover, surround with, besiege,"

<word>bestial</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., from O.Fr. bestial (13c.) "relating to
          animals, stupid, foolish, bestial" and directly from L.
          bestialis "like a beast,"
          from bestia (see beast). Sense of "below the
          dignity of a human" is from c.1400, and in many cases its
          use is unjust to the beasts.

<word>bestow</word>	
<etymology>1773, from bestow + -al (2).

<word>betoken</word>

          from trans- "across" (see trans-) + dare "to give" (see date (1)). Related: Betrayed; betraying.
</etymology>
<word>bevy</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., collective noun of
          quails and ladies, from Anglo-Fr. bev饼/span>, of unknown origin. One
          supposed definition of the word is "a drinking bout," but
          this is perhaps a misprint of bever, from O.Fr. beivre (see beverage). Still, it's
          possible that the original sense could be a company of
          birds gathered at a puddle or pool for drinking or
          bathing.
</etymology>
<word>bicameral</word>	
<etymology>"having two chambers," 1832, from
          bi- "two" + L.L. camera "chamber" (see camera) + -al (1).
</etymology>
<word>bicker</word>	
<etymology>early 14c., bikere, "to skirmish, fight,"
          perhaps from M.Du. bicken
          "to slash, stab, attack," + -er, M.E. frequentative suffix.
          Meaning "to quarrel" is from mid-15c. As a noun, bicker is recorded from c.1300;
          often used to describe the sound of a flight of a
          missile, in which sense it is perhaps at least partly
          echoic.
</etymology>
<word>biennial</word>	
<etymology>1620s, from L. biennium "two-year period," from
          bi- + annus "year." The noun meaning "a

<etymology>1540s, "pertaining to bile,

          peevish, ill-tempered" (as people afflicted with an
          excess of bile were believed to be) is attested from
          1560s. This is the main modern sense in English and
          French; the more literal meaning being taken up by biliary. Related: Biliousness.
</etymology>
<word>bilk</word>	
<etymology>1650s, from the noun (1630s), first
          used as a cribbage term. Origin obscure, it was believed
          in 17c. to be "a word signifying nothing," perhaps of
          Arabic origin; but it is rather perhaps a thinned form of
          balk. Meaning "to defraud" is
          first recorded 1670s. Related: Bilked; bilking.
</etymology>
<word>billowing</word>	
<etymology>1550s, perhaps older in dialectal
          use, from O.N. bylgja "a

          (cf. M.H.G. bulge "billow,

          "night guard," from bei-
          "double, additional" + wacht
          "guard." Original meaning was an army that stayed up on
          night watch; sense of "outdoor camp" is 1853. Not a
          common word in English before the Napoleonic Wars.
          Italian bivacco is from
          French.
</etymology>
<word>bizarre</word>	
<etymology>1640s, from Fr. bizarre "odd, fantastic" (16c.),
          originally "handsome, brave," perhaps from Basque bizar "a beard" (the notion being
          of bearded Spanish soldiers making a strange impression
          on the French); alternative etymology traces it to It.
          bizarro "angry, fierce,

</etymology>
<word>bland</word>	
<etymology>1660s, from It. blando "delicate," or O.Fr. bland "flattering, complimentary,"
          both from L. blandus "mild,
          smooth, flattering, alluring," perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of base
          *mldu- "soft." Latin also
          had blandiloquentulus
          "flattering in speech," which might have yielded a useful
          English *blandiloquent.
</etymology>
<word>blare</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., bleren "to wail," possibly from an
          unrecorded O.E. *bl沥n, or

          thousand-tongued monster representing slander; probably
          suggested by L. blatire "to
          babble." It entered general use 1650s, as "noisy in an
          offensive and vulgar way;" the sense of "obvious,
          glaringly conspicuous" is from 1889.
</etymology>
<word>blighted</word>	
<etymology>"stricken by malignant forces
          (natural or supernatural), cursed, blighted," 1550s, from
          blast (q.v.), with the notion
          of "balefully breathed upon." In the sense of "cursed,
          damned" it is attested from 1680s. Meaning "drunk or
          stoned" dates from 1972.

          is from 1711.
</etymology>
<word>blowhard</word>	
<etymology>early 19c., "boastful," from blow (v.1) + hard. Noun meaning "braggart"
          is recorded from 1820s.

<word>bogus</word>	
<etymology>"counterfeit money," 1839,
          Amer.Eng., apparently from a slang word applied in Ohio
          in 1827 to a counterfeiter's apparatus. Some trace this
          to tantrabobus, a late 18c.
          colloquial Vermont word for any odd-looking object, which
          may be connected to tantarabobs, recorded as a
          Devonshire name for the devil. Others trace it to the
          same source as bogey (1).
</etymology>
<word>bohemian</word>	
<etymology>
            "a gypsy of society," 1848, from Fr. bohemi鮼/span> (1550s), from the
            country name (see Bohemia). The modern sense
            is perhaps from the use of this country name since 15c.
            in French for "gypsy" (they were wrongly believed to
            have come from there, though their first appearance in
            W.Europe may have been directly from there), or from
            association with 15c. Bohemian heretics. It was
            popularized by Henri Murger's 1845 story collection
            "Scenes de la Vie de
            Boheme," the basis of Puccini's "La Boh譥." Used in English 1848
            in Thackary's "Vanity Fair."

            
              The term 'Bohemian' has come to be very commonly
              accepted in our day as the description of a certain
              kind of literary gipsey, no matter in what language
              he speaks, or what city he inhabits .... A Bohemian
              is simply an artist or litt鲡teur who, consciously or
              unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life
              and in art. ["Westminster Review," 1862]
            
          
</etymology>
<word>boisterous</word>	
<etymology>late 15c., unexplained alteration
          of M.E. boistous (c.1300)
          "rough, coarse (as of food), clumsy, violent," of unknown
          origin, perhaps from Anglo-Fr. bustous "rough (road)," which is
          perhaps from O.Fr. boisteos
          "curved, lame; uneven, rough" (Mod.Fr. boiteux), itself of obscure
          origin. Another guess traces it via Celtic to L. bestia. Used of persons from
          1560s.
</etymology>
<word>bolster</word>	
<etymology>O.E. bolster "bolster, cushion,
          something stuffed so that it swells up," especially
          "long, stuffed pillow," from P.Gmc. *bolkhstraz (cf. O.N. bolstr, Dan., Swed., Du. bolster, Ger. polster), from PIE *bhelgh- "to swell" (see belly). The verb in the
          figurative sense is from c.1500, on the notion of "to
          support with a bolster, prop up."
</etymology>
<word>bolt</word>	
<etymology>O.E. bolt "short, stout arrow with a
          heavy head;" also "crossbow for throwing bolts," from
          P.Gmc. *bultas (cf. O.N.
          bolti, Dan. bolt, Du. bout, Ger. Bolzen), perhaps from PIE base
          *bheld- "to knock, strike"
          (cf. Lith. beldu "I knock,"
          baldas "pole for striking").
          Applied since M.E. to other short metal rods (especially
          those with knobbed ends). From the notion of an arrow's
          flight comes the lightning
          bolt (1530s). A bolt
          of canvas (c.1400) was so called for its shape. Adverbial
          phrase bolt upright is from
          late 14c.
</etymology>
<word>bombastic</word>	
<etymology>1704, "inflated," from bombast (q.v.). Meaning "given
          to bombastic language" is from 1727.

<word>boon</word>	
<etymology>in boon
          companion (1560s), only real survival of M.E.
          boon "good" (early 14c.),
          from O.Fr. bon (see bon).
</etymology>
<word>boorish</word>	
<etymology>from Marx, 1850, who used it to
          mean "rabble, poorest of the working class," from Ger.
          lump "ragamuffin" + proletariat. Secondary sense
          of "boorish, stupid people" led to lumpen- being taken as a suffix
          meaning "unenlightened."
</etymology>
<word>bouillon</word>	
<etymology>1650s, from Fr. bouillon (11c.), noun use of pp.
          of bouillir "to boil," from
          O.Fr. bolir (see boil (v.)).
</etymology>
<word>bountiful</word>	
<etymology>late 15c., from bounty + -ful.
</etymology>
<word>bourgeois</word>	
<etymology>
            1560s, "of the French middle class," from Fr. bourgeois, from O.Fr. burgeis, borjois "town dweller"
            (see bourgeoisie). Sense of
            "socially or aesthetically conventional" is from 1764;
            in communist and socialist writing, as a noun, "a
            capitalist" (1883).

            
              It is better to be a good ordinary bourgeois than a
              bad ordinary bohemian. [Aldous Huxley, 1930]
            
          
</etymology>
<word>bovine</word>	
<etymology>1817, from Fr. bovin (14c.), from L.L. bovinus, from L. bos (gen. bovis) "ox, cow," from PIE *gwous- (see cow). Figurative sense of
          "inert and stupid" is from 1855.
</etymology>
<word>bowdlerize</word>	
<etymology>1836, from Thomas Bowdler (1754-1825), English
          editor who in 1818 published a notorious expurgated
          Shakespeare, in which, according to his frontispiece,
          "nothing is added to the original text; but those words
          and expressions omitted which cannot with propriety be
          read aloud in a family."
</etymology>
<word>boycott</word>	
<etymology>1880, from Irish Land League
          ostracism of Capt. Charles C. Boycott (1832-1897), land agent of
          Lough-Mask in County Mayo, who refused to lower rents for
          his tenant farmers. Quickly adopted by newspapers in
          languages as far afield as Japanese (boikotto). The family name is from
          a place in England.
</etymology>
<word>braggadocio</word>	
<etymology>Spenser's coinage, 1590, as a name
          for his personification of vainglory, from brag, with augmentative ending
          by analogy to the Italian words then in vogue in England.
          In general use by 1594 for "an empty swaggerer;" of the
          talk of such persons, from 1734.
</etymology>
<word>braggart</word>	
<etymology>1570s, from Fr. bragard (16c.), with pejorative
          ending (see -ard) + M.Fr. braguer "to flaunt, brag," perhaps
          originally "to show off clothes, especially breeches,"
          from brague "breeches" (see
          bracket). There may be an
          element of codpiece-flaunting in all this. The word in
          English at least has been influenced by brag, even if, as some claim,
          it is unrelated to it.
</etymology>
<word>brandish</word>	
<etymology>mid-14c., from O.Fr. brandiss-, prp. stem of brandir "to flourish (a sword)"
          (12c.), from brant "blade of

          It. bravata "bragging,
          boasting" (16c.), from bravare "brag, boast, be defiant,"
          from bravo (see brave). Influenced in form by
          Sp. words ending in -ado.

          from brawn + -y (2).
</etymology>
<word>brazen</word>	
<etymology>O.E. br泥n "of brass," from br泼/span> "brass" + see -en (2). The figurative sense
          of "hardened in effrontery" is 1570s (in brazen-face), perhaps suggesting a
          face unable to show shame (see brass). To brazen it out "face impudently" is
          from 1550s.
</etymology>
<word>breach</word>	
<etymology>O.E. bryce "breach, fracture, a
          breaking," from brecan (see
          break), influenced by O.Fr.
          breche "breach, opening,
          gap," from Frankish; both from P.Gmc. *brecho, *br櫯 "broken," from PIE
          base *bhreg- "to break" (see
          fraction). Figurative sense of
          "a breaking of rules, etc." was in O.E. The verb is first

<etymology>1520s, alteration of brede "breadth," from O.E. br椵 "breadth, width, extent," from

<etymology>c.1500, from L. brevitatem (nom. brevitas) "shortness" in space or
          time, from brevis "short"
          (see brief).
</etymology>
<word>brindled</word>	
<etymology>"marked with streaks, streaked with
          a dark color," 1670s, from M.E. brended (early 15c.), from bren "brown color" (13c.), noun
          made from pp. of brennen
          "burn," perhaps meaning "marked as though by branding or
          burning." Form altered perhaps by influence of kindled.
</etymology>
<word>bristling</word>	
<etymology>O.E. byrst "bristle," with metathesis
          of -r-, from P.Gmc. *bors- (cf. M.Du. borstel, Ger. borste), from PIE *bhrsti- from base *bhar- "point, bristle" (cf. Skt.
          bhrstih "point, spike").

          animals show fight. Related: Bristled; bristling.
</etymology>
<word>brittle</word>	
<etymology>M.E. britel, perhaps from an unrecorded
          O.E. adj. *brytel, related
          to brytan "to crush, pound,
          to break to pieces," from P.Gmc. stem *brutila- "brittle," from *breutan "to break up" (cf. O.N.
          brjota "to break," O.H.G.
          brodi "fragile"), and
          related to bruise. With -le, suffix forming adjectives
          with meaning "liable to."
</etymology>
<word>broach</word>	
<etymology>"begin to talk about," 1570s, from
          figurative use of the lit. meaning "to pierce" (early
          14c.), with suggestions of "broaching" a cask or spurring
          into action (cf. O.Fr. brochier, 12c., "to spur," also

</etymology>
<word>brook</word>	
<etymology>New York City borough, named for
          village founded there 1646, named for Dutch township of
          Breukelen near Utrecht; from
          O.H.G. bruoh "moor,
          marshland;" spelling of U.S. place name influenced by
          brook (n.).
</etymology>
<word>browbeat</word>	
<etymology>
            "to bully," originally "to bear down with stern or
            arrogant looks," 1580s, from brow + beat (v.). 

            
              [I]t appears from the earliest quotations ... that
              the brow in question was
              that of the beater, not of the beaten party; but it
              is not evident whether the meaning was 'to beat with
              one's (frowning) brows,' or 'to beat (?lower) one's
              brows at.' [OED]
            
            Related: Browbeaten; browbeating.

          brouster, from O.Fr. broster "to sprout, bud," from
          brost "young shoot, twig,"
          probably from P.Gmc. *brustjan "to bud." Lost its final
          -t in English on the
          mistaken notion that it was a pp. inflection. Figurative
          extension to "peruse" (books) is 1870s, Amer.Eng.
</etymology>
<word>brunt</word>	
<etymology>early 14c., "a sharp blow," of

<etymology>1660s, from Fr. boucanier "user of a boucan," a native grill for
          roasting meat, from Tupi mukem (rendered in Port. as moquem c.1587): "initial b and m
          are interchangeable in the Tupi language" [Klein]. For
          Haitian variant barbacoa,
          see barbecue. Originally used of
          French settlers working as hunters and woodsmen in the
          Spanish West Indies, a lawless and piratical set after
          they were driven from their trade by Spanish authorities
          in the 1690s.

<word>bugaboo</word>	
<etymology>1843, earlier buggybow (1740), probably an
          alteration of bugbear (see
          bug), but connected by Chapman
          ["Dictionary of American Slang"] with Bugibu, demon in the O.Fr. poem
          "Aliscans" from 1141, which
          is perhaps of Celtic origin (cf. Cornish bucca-boo, from bucca "bogle, goblin").
</etymology>
<word>bullion</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., "uncoined gold or
          silver," from Anglo-Norm. bullion "bar of precious metal,"
          also "place where coins are made, mint," perhaps, through
          the notion of "melting," from O.Fr. boillir "to boil," from L. bullire "boil." But perhaps it is
          rather from O.Fr. bille
          "stick, block of wood."
</etymology>
<word>bulwark</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., from M.Du. bulwerke or M.H.G. bolwerc, from bole "plank, tree trunk" (from

          from 1570s.
</etymology>
<word>bungle</word>	
<etymology>1520s, origin obscure, perhaps a
          mix of boggle and bumble, or more likely from a

          from O.Swed. bunga "to

<word>burlesque</word>	
<etymology>1660s, "derisive imitation,
          grotesque parody," from Fr. burlesque (16c.), from It. burlesco, from burla "joke, fun, mockery,"
          possibly ultimately from L.L. burra "trifle, nonsense," lit.
          "flock of wool." Modern sense of "variety show featuring

          "endanger," verb form of pliht "danger, risk," from P.Gmc.
          *pleg- (cf. O.E. pleon "to risk the loss of, expose
          to danger," O.Fris., M.Du. plicht "care, carefulness," O.H.G.

<word>buttress</word>	
<etymology>early 14c., from O.Fr. botrez "flying buttress," lit.
          "buttressed," pl. of boteret
          "support," from bouter "to
          thrust against," of Frankish origin (cf. O.N. bauta "to strike, beat"), from
          P.Gmc. *butan, from PIE base
          *bhau- "to strike" (see butt (v.)). The verb is from
          late 14c.

<word>buxom</word>	
<etymology>late 12c., buhsum "humble, obedient," from
          *buh- stem of O.E. bugen "to bow" + -som, for a total meaning "capable
          of being bent." Meaning progressed from "compliant,
          obliging," through "lively, jolly," "healthily plump,
          vigorous," to (in women, and perhaps influenced by lusty) "plump, comely" (1580s).
          Du. buigzaam, Ger. biegsam "flexible, pliable" hew
          closer to the original sense of the English cognate.
</etymology>
<word>cabal</word>	
<etymology>1520s, "mystical interpretation of
          the Old Testament," later "society, small group meeting
          privately" (1660s), from Fr. cabal, in both senses, from M.L.
          cabbala (see cabbala). Popularized in
          English 1673 as an acronym for five intriguing ministers
          of Charles II (Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley,
          and Lauderdale), which gave the word its sinister
          connotations.
</etymology>
<word>cache</word>	
<etymology>1926, from Fr., from cacher "to hide" + sexe "genitals" (fem.).
</etymology>
<word>cadence</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "flow of rhythm in verse
          or music," from M.Fr. cadence, O.It. cadenza "conclusion of a movement
          in music," lit. "a falling," from V.L. *cadentia, from L. neut. pl. of
          cadens (gen. cadentis), prp. of cadere "to fall" (see case (1)). In 16c., sometimes
          used literally for "an act of falling."
</etymology>
<word>calamity</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., from M.Fr. calamite (14c.), from L. calamitatem (nom. calamitas) "damage, loss, failure;
          disaster, misfortune, adversity," origin obscure. Early
          etymologists associated it with calamus "straw," but it is perhaps
          from a lost root preserved in incolumis "uninjured."
</etymology>
<word>calculated</word>	
<etymology>1863, "devised beforehand," pp.
          adj. from calculate. Earlier, "suited,

</etymology>
<word>caliber</word>	
<etymology>1560s, "degree of merit or
          importance," from M.Fr. calibre (late 15c.), apparently
          ultimately from Arabic qalib
          "a mold for casting." Arabic also used the word in the
          sense "mold for casting bullets," which is the original
          literal meaning in English, though the earliest cited
          sense is a figurative one. Meaning "inside diameter of a
          gun barrel" is attested from 1580s. Barnhart remarks that
          Sp. calibre, It. calibro "appear too late to act as
          intermediate forms" between the Arabic word and the
          French.
</etymology>
<word>calligraphy</word>	
<etymology>1610s, from Gk. kaligraphia, from kallos "beauty" + graphein "to write" (see -graphy). Related: Calligraphic. The usual comb. form
          in Greek was kalli-
          "beautiful, fine, happy, favorable;" kalo- was a later, rarer
          alternative form.
</etymology>
<word>callous</word>	
<etymology>c.1400, "hardened," in the physical
          sense, from L. callosus
          "thick-skinned," from callus, callum "hard skin" (see callus). The figurative sense
          of "unfeeling" appeared in English by 1670s.
</etymology>
<word>callow</word>	
<etymology>O.E. calu "bare, bald," prob. from
          W.Gmc. *kalwaz (cf. M.Du.

          From young birds with no feathers, meaning extended to
          any young inexperienced thing or creature (1570s).
          Apparently not from L. calvus "bald."

          colors," from It. cammeo
          (13c.), from M.L. camm浳, of
          unknown origin, perhaps ultimately from Arabic qamaa'il "flower buds," or Pers.
          chumahan "agate."
          Transferred sense of "small character or part that stands
          out from other minor parts" in a play, etc., is from
          1928, from earlier meaning "short literary sketch or
          portrait" (1851).
</etymology>
<word>camouflage</word>	
<etymology>1917, from Fr. camoufler, Parisian slang, "to
          disguise," from It. camuffare "to disguise," perhaps a
          contraction of capo muffare
          "to muffle the head." Probably altered by Fr. camouflet "puff of smoke," on the
          notion of "blow smoke in someone's face." The British
          navy in World War I called it dazzle-painting.
</etymology>
<word>canard</word>	
<etymology>before 1850, from Fr. canard "a hoax," lit. "a duck"
          (from O.Fr. quanart,
          probably echoic of a duck's quack); said by Littr頴o be
          from the phrase vendre un canard
          ࠭oiti鼯span> "to half-sell a duck," thus, from some
          long-forgotten joke, "to cheat."
</etymology>
<word>candor</word>	
<etymology>"openness of mind, impartiality,
          frankness," c.1600, from L. candor "purity, openness,"
          originally "whiteness," from candere "to shine, to be white"
          (see candle). Borrowed earlier in
          English (c.1500) with the L. literal sense "extreme
          whiteness."
</etymology>
<word>canine</word>	
<etymology>"pointed tooth," late 14c., from L.
          caninus "of the dog," gen.
          of canis "dog," from PIE

          kyon, O.E. hund, O.H.G. hunt, O.Ir. cu, Welsh ci, Skt. svan-, Avestan spa, Rus. sobaka (apparently from an Iranian
          source), Armenian shun,

          recorded 1869.

          O.N.Fr. cancre (Mod.Fr.
          chancre). The word was the
          common one for "cancer" until c.1700. Canker blossom is recorded from
          1580s.
</etymology>
<word>canon</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "to place in the canon
          or calendar of saints," from O.Fr. cannonisier and directly from M.L.
          canonizare, from L.L. canon "church rule" (see canon (1)). Related: Canonized; cannonizing.
</etymology>
<word>cantankerous</word>	
<etymology>1772, said to be "a Wiltshire
          word," probably an alteration (influenced by raucous) of M.E. contakour "troublemaker" (c.1300),
          from Anglo-Fr. contec
          "discord, strife," from O.Fr. contechier, from con- "with" + teche, related to atachier "hold fast" (see attach).

</etymology>
<word>canvass</word>	
<etymology>c.1500, from canvas and probably meaning,
          originally, "to toss in a canvas sheet," hence "to shake
          out, examine carefully" (1520s); "to solicit votes"
          (1550s); though "to sift through canvas" also has been
          proposed as the basic metaphor. The spelling with a
          double -s- dates from 16c.
          As a noun, attested from c.1600.
</etymology>
<word>capacious</word>	
<etymology>1610s, from L. capax (gen. capacis), from capere "to take" (see capable).
</etymology>
<word>capacity</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., from M.Fr. capacit鼯span> (15c.), from L. capacitatem (nom. capacitas) "breadth, capacity,"
          from capax (gen. capacis) "able to hold much," from
          capere "to take" (see capable). Meaning "largest

          1650s.
</etymology>
<word>capillary</word>	
<etymology>1650s (adj.), 1660s (n.), from L.
          capillaris "of hair," from
          capillus "hair" (of the

<word>capitulate</word>	
<etymology>1570s, "to draw up in chapters"

          terms" (1680s). Related: Capitulated; capitulating.
</etymology>
<word>caprice</word>	
<etymology>1660s, from Fr. caprice "whim" (16c.), from It.
          capriccio "whim," originally
          "a shivering," possibly from capro "goat," with reference to
          frisking; but another theory connects the It. word with
          capo "head" + riccio "curl, frizzled," lit.
          "hedgehog" (from L. ericius). The notion in this case
          would be of the hair standing on end in horror, hence the
          person shivering in fear.
</etymology>
<word>caption</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "taking, seizure," from
          O.Fr. capcion "arrest,
          capture, imprisonment," from L. capito (gen. captionis) "a catching, seizing,
          holding," from captus, pp.
          of capere "to take" (see capable). Sense evolved from
          headings of legal indictments involving seizure ("Certificate of caption"), the
          word being taken to mean the beginning of any document;
          thus "heading of a chapter or section of an article"
          (1789), and, especially in U.S., "description or title
          below an illustration" (1919).
</etymology>
<word>frivolous</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c., from L. frivolus "silly, empty, trifling,
          worthless, brittle," dim. of *frivos "broken, crumbled," from

</etymology>
<word>carafe</word>	
<etymology>1786, from Fr. carafe (17c.), from It. caraffa (or Sp. garrafa), probably from Arabic

          Pers. qarabah "a large
          flagon."
</etymology>
<word>carapace</word>	
<etymology>1836, from Fr. carapace "tortoise shell" (18c.),
          from Port. carapa硼/span>, of
          uncertain origin, perhaps somehow from L. capa (see cape (1)).
</etymology>
<word>carat</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c., from M.Fr. carat "measure of the fineness of
          gold" (14c.), from It. carato, from Arabic qirat "pod, husk, weight of 4
          grains," from Gk. keration
          "carob seed," lit. "little horn" dim. of keras "horn." Carob beans were a
          standard for weighing small quantities. As a measure of
          diamond weight, from 1570s. The Gk. measure was the
          equivalent of the Roman siliqua, which was
          one-twentyfourth of a golden solidus of Constantine;
          hence the word took on a sense of "a proportion of one
          twentyfourth" and became a measure of gold purity
          (1550s). Eighteen carat gold is eighteen parts gold, six
          parts alloy. It is unlikely that the classical carat was
          ever a measure of weight for gold.
</etymology>
<word>carcinogenic</word>

          (Genoese dialect) carena,
          from L. carina "keel of a
          ship," originally "nutshell." Generalized sense of "to
          lean, to tilt" is 1883. Related: Careened; careening. Confused with career (v.) since at least
          1923. To career is to move

<word>cartographer</word>	
<etymology>continent name attributed to
          Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew
          (1860-1920), who used it on a map published 1887. From antarctic (q.v.). Hypothetical
          southern continents had been imagined since antiquity;
          first sighting of Antarctica by Europeans probably was
          1820 (Lazarev and Bellingshausen). Also cf. Antipodes.

          use of adj. from kata "down"

          PIE *gloi- "to stick" (see
          clay). The confusion was less
          in O.E. when cleave (1) was
          a class 2 strong verb; but it has grown since cleave (1) weakened, which may be
          why both are largely superseded by stick and split.
</etymology>

          related to -clinare "to
          lean" (see lean (v.)) + participial
          suffix -menos (also in alumnus). For sense evolution, cf.
          inclined in secondary
          meaning "disposed favorably." Meaning "mildness of
          weather or climate" is 1660s (a sense also in Latin);
          clement (adj.) is older in
          both senses, late 15c. and 1620s respectively, but now is
          used only in negation and only of the weather.

          Apparently this word was at one time treated as the

          that word's theatrical sense.
</etymology>
<word>cloister</word>	
<etymology>early 13c., from O.Fr. cloistre "monastery, convent"
          (12c., Mod.Fr. cloe) or

<word>curmudgeon</word>	
<etymology>1570s, of unknown origin; the
          suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from
          Johnson, that it is from Fr. coeur
          mechant "evil heart" is not taken seriously; the
          first syllable may be cur

          of unknown origin, was the name of a card game popular

<word>die</word>	
<etymology>mid-12c., possibly from O.Dan.
          dspan> or O.N. deyja "to die, pass away," both
          from P.Gmc. *dawjanan (cf.
          O.Fris. deja "to kill," O.S.
          doian, O.H.G. touwen, Goth. diwans "mortal"), from PIE base
          *dheu- (3) "to pass away,
          become senseless" (cf. O.Ir. dith "end, death," O.C.S. daviti, Rus. davit' "to choke, suffer"). It has
          been speculated that O.E. had *diegan, from the same source, but
          it is not in any of the surviving texts and the preferred
          words were steorfan (see starve), sweltan (see swelter), wesan dead, also for𧡮 and other euphemisms.
          Languages usually don't borrow words from abroad for
          central life experiences, but "die" words are an
          exception, since they are often hidden or changed
          euphemistically out of superstitious dread. A Dutch
          euphemism translates as "to give the pipe to Maarten."
          Regularly spelled dege
          through 15c., and still pronounced "dee" by some in
          Lancashire and Scotland. Used figuratively (of sounds,
          etc.) from 1580s. Related: Died; dies.

          only of situations where someone is forced to choose

          appreciate," originally "to pick out, select," from dis- "apart" (see dis-) + legere "choose, gather" (see lecture). Sense evolved from
          "love" through "attentiveness" to "carefulness" to
          "steady effort." From the secondary French sense comes
          the old useage of diligence
          for "public stage coach" (1742; dilly for short), from a French
          shortening of carrosse de

          from Anglo-Fr. erraunt, from
          two O.Fr. words that were confused even before they
          reached English: 1. O.Fr. errant, prp. of errer "to travel or wander," from
          L.L. iterare, from L. iter "journey, way," from root of
          ire "to go" (see ion); 2. O.Fr. errant, pp. of errer (see err). The senses fused in

          from scappare, from the same
          V.L. source. Figurative sense (1814) is of "breaking

          from L. fel "gall, poison,"
          on the notion of "one full of bitterness." Another theory
          (advanced by Professor R. Atkinson of Dublin) traces it

          fecund), which had an obscene
          secondary meaning in classical Latin (well-known to
          readers of Martial and Catullus), which would make a
          felon etymologically a
          "cock-sucker." OED inclines toward the "gall"
          explanation, but finds Atkinson's "most plausible" of the

          from 1819. Related: Feted;
          fetes; feting.

<word>fiasco</word>	
<etymology>1855, theater slang for "a
          failure," by 1862 acquired the general sense of any
          dismal flop, on or off the stage. Via Fr. phrase fiare fiasco "turn out a failure"
          (19c.), from It. far fiasco
          "suffer a complete breakdown in performance," lit. "make
          a bottle," from fiasco
          "bottle," from L.L. flasco,
          flasconem (see flask). The reason for all
          this is utterly obscure today, but "the usual range of
          fanciful theories has been advanced" [Ayto]. Weekley
          finds it utterly mysterious and compares Fr. ramasser un pelle "to come a
          cropper (in bicycling), lit. to pick up a shovel." OED
          makes nebulous reference to "alleged incidents in Italian
          theatrical history." Klein suggests Venetian
          glass-crafters tossing aside imperfect pieces to be made
          later into common flasks. But according to an Italian
          dictionary, fare il fiasco
          used to mean "to play a game so that the one that loses
          will pay the fiasco," in
          other words, he will buy the next bottle (of wine). That
          plausibly connects the word with the notion of "a costly
          mistake."

<word>fiat</word>	
<etymology>"authoritative sanction," 1630s,
          from L. fiat "let it be

          commands), third person singular present subjunctive of
          fieri, used as passive of
          facere "to make, do" (see factitious). Also sometimes a
          reference to fiat lux "let
          there be light" in the Book of Genesis.

          displeases," piger
          "reluctant, lazy"). Sense of "changeable" is first
          recorded late 13c. Related: Fickleness.

<word>filch</word>	
<etymology>"steal," 1560s, slang, perhaps from
          c.1300 filchen "to snatch,

          [Watkins].
</etymology>
<word>filibuster</word>	
<etymology>1580s, flibutor "pirate," probably
          ultimately from Du. vrijbuiter "freebooter," used of
          pirates in the West Indies as Sp. filibustero and Fr. flibustier, either or both of
          which gave the word to Amer.Eng. (see freebooter). Used 1850s and
          '60s of lawless adventurers from the U.S. who tried to
          overthrow Central American countries. The legislative
          sense is first recorded c.1851, probably because
          obstructionist legislators "pirated" debate. Not
          technically restricted to U.S. Senate, but that's where
          the strategy works best. The verb is recorded by 1853 in
          both the freebooting and the legislative senses. Related:
          Filibustered; filibustering.
</etymology>
<word>pendant</word>	
<etymology>c.1400, "loose, hanging part of

          part of an earring" is attested from 1550s. Nautical

<word>filing</word>	
<etymology>metal tool, O.E. feol (Mercian fil), from P.Gmc. *finkhlo (cf. O.S., O.H.G. fila, M.Du. vile, Du. vijl, Ger. Feile), probably from PIE *peig- "to cut, mark by incision"
          (cf. Skt. pimsati "hews out,

          paint," O.C.S. pila "file,

</etymology>
<word>finicky</word>	
<etymology>1825, "dainty, mincing," from finical "too particular" (1590s),
          perhaps from fine (adj.) +
          -ical as in cynical, ironical. The -k- between the final -c- and a suffix beginning in
          -i, -y, or -e is an orthographic rule to mark
          the pronunciation of -c- as
          "k" (cf. picnicking, trafficking, panicky, shellacked).

<word>flag</word>	
<etymology>"cloth ensign," late 15c., now in
          all modern Germanic languages, but apparently first
          recorded in English, origin unknown, but likely connected
          with flag (v.) or else, like it,
          perhaps onomatopoeic. A less likely guess is that it is
          from the flag in flagstone on notion of being
          square and flat. U.S. Flag
          Day (1894) is in reference to the adopting of the

          1777.

          (cf. Gk. phlegein "to burn,
          scorch," L. fulgere "to
          shine"), from base *bhel-
          (1) (see bleach). Sense of "glaringly
          offensive" first recorded 1706, probably from common
          legalese phrase in flagrante
          delicto "red-handed," lit. "with the crime still
          blazing." Related: Flagrantly.
</etymology>
<word>flail</word>	
<etymology>"implement for threshing grain,"
          c.1100, perhaps from an unrecorded O.E. *flegel, which probably represents
          W.Gmc. *flagil (cf. M.Du.,
          Low Ger. vlegel, O.H.G.
          flegel, Ger. flegel), a borrowing of L.L. flagellum "winnowing tool, flail,"

            astronomical sense emerged 1848. Figurative sense of
            "brilliant assembly of persons" is from 1580s. Milky Way is a translation of L.

            Astronomers began to speculate by mid-19c. that some of
            the spiral nebulae they
            could see in telescopes were actually immense and
            immensely distant structures the size and shape of the

          "breeze," or O.Dan. gal
          "bad, furious" (often used of weather), from O.N. galinn "bewitched." Or perhaps it

<word>gambit</word>	
<etymology>"chess opening in which a pawn is
          risked for advantage later," 1650s, gambett, from It. gambetto, lit. "a tripping up" (as

          openings in Spanish in 1561 by Ruy Lopez, who traced it
          to the Italian word, but the form in Spanish generally
          was gambito, which led to
          Fr. gambit, which has
          influenced the English spelling of the word. Broader
          sense of "opening move meant to gain advantage" in
          English is recorded from 1855.
</etymology>
<word>gambol</word>

               Solve polluti labii reatum,
            
            etc. Gamut came to be used
            for "the whole musical scale;" the figurative sense of

          1530s.
</etymology>
<word>garbled</word>	
<etymology>1570s, of unknown origin; the
          suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from
          Johnson, that it is from Fr. coeur
          mechant "evil heart" is not taken seriously; the
          first syllable may be cur
          "dog." Liberman says the word "must have been borrowed
          from Gaelic (and references muigean "disagreeable person"),
          with variant spelling of intensive prefix ker-. Related: Curmudgeonly.
</etymology>
<word>gargoyle</word>

          gargole "throat, waterspout"
          (see gargle).
</etymology>
<word>garish</word>	
<etymology>1540s, possibly from obsolete M.E.

</etymology>
<word>garnish</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "set of tableware"

</etymology>
<word>gastronomy</word>	
<etymology>1814, from Fr. gastronomie, coined 1800 by Joseph
          de Berchoux (1762-1838) as title of poem on good living,
          after Gastrologia, title of
          a now-lost poem of antiquity, quoted by Athenaeus (see gastrology). Berchoux’s word
          is from gaster + nomos “arranging, regulating.”
          Related: Gastronomer.
</etymology>
<word>gauche</word>	
<etymology>"awkward, tactless," 1751
          (Chesterfield), from Fr. gauche "left" (15c., replacing
          O.Fr. senestre in that
          sense), originally "awkward, awry," from M.Fr. gauchir "turn aside, swerve," from
          O.Fr. gaucher "trample,
          reel, walk clumsily," from Frankish *welkan "to full," from P.Gmc.
          *wankjan (cf. O.H.G. wankon, O.N. vakka "to stagger, totter;" see wink).
</etymology>
<word>gaudy</word>	
<etymology>"showy, tastelessly rich," 1580s,
          probably ultimately from M.E. gaudi "large, ornamental bead in a
          rosary" (early 14c.); but there is a parallel sense of
          gaudy as "full of trickery"
          (1520s), from M.E. gaud
          "deception, trick," from gaudi "a jest, trick," possibly
          from Anglo-Fr. gaudir "be
          merry, scoff," from L. gaudere "rejoice" (see joy). Alternative etymology of
          the adjective is from M.E. gaudegrene "yellowish-green"
          (early 14c.), originally "green dye" obtained from a
          plant formerly known as weld, from a Germanic source (see
          weld (n.)), which became gaude in Old French. The English
          term supposedly shifted sense from "weld-dye" to
          "bright." As a noun, "feast, festival" 1650s, from gaudy day "day of rejoicing"
          (1560s).
</etymology>
<word>gaunt</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c. (as a surname from
          mid-13c.), from M.Fr. gant,
          of uncertain origin; perhaps from a Scandinavian source
          (cf. O.N. gand "a thin
          stick," also "a tall thin man") and somehow connected
          with the root of gander.
          Connection also has been suggested to O.Fr. jaunet "yellowish" [Middle English
          Dictionary].
</etymology>
<word>gavel</word>	
<etymology>"small mallet used by presiding
          officers at meetings," 1805, Amer.Eng., of unknown
          origin; perhaps connected with Ger. dial. gaffel "brotherhood, friendly
          society," from M.H.G. gaffel
          "society, guild," related to O.E. gafol "tribute," giefan "to give" (see habit). But in some sources
          gavel also is identified as
          a type of mason's tool, in which case the extended
          meaning may be via freemasonry. As a verb, by 1887, from
          the noun.
</etymology>
<word>gawk</word>	
<etymology>1785, Amer.Eng., perhaps from gaw, a survival from M.E. gowen "to stare" (c.1200), from a

          worship" (see favor (n.)); and altered
          perhaps by gawk hand (see gawky). Liberman writes that
          it "need not have been derived from gowk. It is possibly another
          independent onomatopoeic formation with the structure
          g-k. Related: Gawked; gawking.
</etymology>
<word>gazette</word>	
<etymology>“to announce in the Gazette,”

          "origin, creation, generation," from gignesthai "to be born," related

<word>genteel</word>	
<etymology>1590s, from M.Fr. gentil "stylish, fashionable,
          elegant; nice, graceful, pleasing," from O.Fr. gentil "high-born, noble" (11c.);

          English as gentle (q.v.), with French
          pronunciation and stress preserved to emphasize the
          distinction. Cf. also jaunty; gentile. OED 2nd ed. reports

          persons" is from 1520s. Earlier in both senses was gentrice (c.1200 as "nobility of
          character," late 14c. as "noble persons"). In
          Anglo-Irish, gentry was a
          name for "the fairies" (1880), and gentle could mean "enchanted"
          (1823).

          modern sense of "closely connected, relevant" (c.1600)
          derives from use in "Hamlet" Act V, Scene ii: "The phrase
          would bee more Germaine to the matter: If we could carry
          Cannon by our sides," which is a figurative use of the
          word in the now-obsolete sense of "closely related, akin"
          (late 15c.) in reference to things, not persons.

          Celt. glan "clean, pure").
          Figurative sense was earlier in English than the literal

          Related: Gleaned; gleaning.

          explanation," from gloss (n.2). From 1650s as "to
          add luster," from gloss (n.1). Figurative sense
          of "smooth over, hide" is from 1729, mostly from gloss (n.1) but showing
          influence of gloss (n.2) in the extended
          verbal sense of "explain away" (1630s), from idea of a

          difficult word. Related: Glossed; glossing.

          (cf. Norw. dial. glora "to
          glow"), from P.Gmc. base *glo- (see glow), root of O.E. glowan "to glow," which influenced
          the spelling. Or perhaps related to M.Du. gluren "to leer." Meaning "to look

<word>gnarled</word>	
<etymology>
            the source of the group of words that includes gnarl (v.), gnarl (n.), gnarly is Shakespeare's use of

              Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt Splits the vn-wedgable
              and gnarled Oke. ["Measure for Measure," II.ii.116]
            
            OED and Barnhart call it a variant of knurled, from M.E. knar "knot in wood" (late 14c.),
            originally "a rock, a stone;" of uncertain origin.
            "(Gnarled) occurs in one
            passage of Shakes. (for which the sole authority is the
            folio of 1623), whence it came into general use in the
            nineteenth century" [OED].

<word>gnome</word>	
<etymology>"dwarf-like earth-dwelling spirit,"

          a treatise by Paracelsus, who gave the name pigmaei or gnomi to elemental earth beings,
          possibly from Gk. *genomos
          "earth-dweller" (cf. thalassonomos "inhabitant of the
          sea"). A less-likely suggestion is that Paracelsus based
          it on the homonym that means "intelligence" (preserved in
          gnomic). Popular in children's
          literature 19c. as a name for red-capped German and Swiss
          folklore dwarfs. Garden figurines first imported to
          England late 1860s from Germany.

<word>goad</word>	
<etymology>O.E. gad "point, spearhead, arrowhead,"

<etymology>c.1300, "spider threads spun in
          fields of stubble in late fall," apparently from gos "goose" + sumer "summer" (cf. Swed. sommertrad "summer thread"). The
          reference might be to a fancied resemblance of the silk
          to goose down, or because geese are in season then. The
          German equivalent m䤣hensommer (lit. "girls' summer")
          also has a sense of "Indian summer," and the English word
          originally may have referred to a warm spell in autumn
          before being transferred to a phenomenon especially
          noticable then. Cf. obsolete Scottish go-summer "period of summer-like
          weather in late autumn." Meaning "anything light or
          flimsy" is from c.1400. The adjective sense "filmy" is

<word>gourmand</word>	
<etymology>
            late 15c., "glutton," from M.Fr. gourmant "glutton," originally
            an adj., "gluttonous," of uncertain origin. Not
            connected with gourmet. Meaning "one fond
            of good eating" is from 1758. 

            
              The gourmand is one
              whose chief pleasure is eating; but a gourmet is a connoisseur of
              food and wines. In England the difference is this: a
              gourmand regards
              quantity more than quality, a gourmet quality more than
              quantity. [Brewer, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable,"

<word>gull</word>	
<etymology>cant term for "dupe, sucker,

          pleased," Avestan zaosa-
          "pleasure," O.Pers. dauš-

          Germanic and Celtic (cf. O.E. cosan, cesan "to choose," Goth.
          kausjan "to test, to taste
          of," O.H.G. koston "try,"
          Ger. kosten "taste of"). The

          "bird plumage" is first recorded early 15c., though this
          might be from unrelated M.E. hackle "flax comb" (see heckle) on supposed
          resemblance of comb to ruffled feathers. Metaphoric
          extension found in raise one's
          hackles (as a cock does when angry) is first

</etymology>
<word>hackneyed</word>

          "one who writes anything for hire."
</etymology>
<word>haggard</word>	
<etymology>1560s, "wild, unruly" (originally

          base *kagh- "to catch,
          seize;" also "wickerwork, fence" (see hedge). OED, however, finds
          this whole derivation "very doubtful." Sense perhaps
          reinforced by Low Ger. hager
          "gaunt, haggard." Sense of "with a haunted expression"
          first recorded 1690s, that of "careworn" first recorded
          1853. Sense influenced by association with hag (q.v.). Related: Haggardly.

          of haggen "to chop" (see hack (1)). Sense of "argue

          of chopping away. Related: Haggled; haggling.

<word>halcyon</word>	
<etymology>1540s, in halcyon dayes (L. alcyonei dies, Gk. alkyonides hemerai), 14 days of

          nest floating on calm seas. From halcyon (n.), late 14c., from L.
          halcyon, from Gk. halkyon, variant (perhaps a
          misspelling) of alkyon
          "kingfisher," from hals
          "sea, salt" (see halo-) + kyon "conceiving," prp. of kyein "to conceive," lit. "to
          swell," from PIE base *keue-

          origin, perhaps from PIE *ser- "to seize" (cf. Hittite
          šaru "booty," Welsh herw "booty").
          
          The Greek word was used in N.T. in reference to the
          Sadducees, Pharisees, and even the Christians, as sects
          of Judaism, but in English bibles it usually is
          translated sect. Meaning "religious
          belief opposed to the orthodox doctrines of the Church"
          evolved in Late Latin in the Dark Ages. Transferred
          (non-religious) use from late 14c.

          sense was hermitorie
          (c.1200), from M.L. hermitorium. Transferred sense of
          "solitary or secluded dwelling place" is from 1640s.

<word>hew</word>	
<etymology>O.E. heawan "to chop, hack, gash"
          (class VII strong verb; past tense heow, pp. heawen), earlier geheawan, from P.Gmc. *hawwan (cf. O.N. hoggva, O.Fris. hawa, O.S. hauwan, M.Du. hauwen, Du. houwen, O.H.G. houwan, Ger. hauen "to cut, strike, hew"), from

          forge;" L. cudere "to
          strike, beat;" M.Ir. cuad
          "beat, fight"). Weak pp. hewede appeared 14c., but hasn't
          displaced hewn. Seemingly contradictory
          sense of "hold fast, stick to" (in phrase hew to) developed from hew to the line "stick to a

          of greatest vigor" first recorded 1751, which altered the

          connection.
</etymology>
<word>hiatus</word>

          sacred rites," from ta hiera
          "the sacred rites" (neuter plural of hieros "sacred;" see ire) + arkhein "to lead, rule" (see archon). Sense of "ranked

          "hieroglyphic; of Egyptian writing," from hieros "sacred" (see ire) + glyphe "carving," from glyphein "to carve" (see glyph). Plutarch began the

          "graceful, kindly." In ancient Rome, Hilaria (neut. pl. of hilaris) were a class of holidays,
          times of pomp and rejoicing; there were public ones in

          birth.

            World War II," first recorded 1957, earlier known in
            Hebrew as Shoah
            "catastrophe." The word itself was used in English in

              Increase of population, which is filling the States
              out to their very borders, together with a new and
              extended network of railroads and other avenues, and
              an internal commerce which daily becomes more
              intimate, is rapidly bringing the States into a
              higher and more perfect social unity or
              consolidation. Thus, these antagonistic systems are
              continually coming into closer contact, and collision
              results.
              
              Shall I tell you what this collision means? They who
              think that it is accidental, unnecessary, the work of
              interested or fanatical agitators, and therefor
              ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an
              irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring
              forces, and it means that the United States must and
              will, sooner or later, become either entirely a
              slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.

            That this is pleasure and not torment for the client is

          from L. libertinus "member
          of a class of freedmen," from libertus "one's freedmen," from
          liber "free" (see liberal). Sense of
          "freethinker" is first recorded 1560s, from Fr. libertin (1540s) originally the
          name given to certain Protestant sects in France and the
          Low Countries. Meaning "dissolute or licentious person"
          first recorded 1590s; the darkening of meaning being
          perhaps due to misunderstanding of L. libertinus in Acts vi.9.

<word>liberty</word>	
<etymology>
            late 14c., from O.Fr. libert鼯span> "freedom," from L.
            libertatem (nom. libertas) "freedom, condition of
            a freeman," from liber
            "free" (see liberal)

            
              The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too
              sure it is right. [Learned Hand, 1944]
            
            Nautical sense of "leave of absence" is from 1758. To
            take liberties "go beyond
            the bounds of propriety" is from 1620s. Sense of
            "privileges" led to sense of "a person's private land"
            (mid-15c.), which yielded sense in 18c. England and
            America of "a district within a county but having its
            own justice of the peace," and also "a district
            adjacent to a city and in some degree under its
            municipal jurisdiction" (e.g. Northern Liberties of
            Philadelphia).

          justifiable etymologically," according to OED, but "has
          arisen because lingual

          Instead, they suggest an independent formation meant to
          "express the notion of something massive by a word of
          appropriate sound." Logging
          "act of cutting timber" is from 1706. Log cabin in Amer.Eng. has been a

<etymology>"timber sawn into rough planks,"
          1660s, Amer.Eng. (Massachusetts), earlier "disused bit of
          furniture; heavy, useless objects" (1550s), probably from
          lumber (v.), perhaps
          influenced by Lombard, from
          the Italian immigrants famous as pawnbrokers and
          money-lenders in England (see Lombard). The evolution of
          sense would be because a lumber-house ("pawn shop")
          naturally accumulates odds and ends of furniture.

<etymology>
            early 15c., from O.Fr. (danse)
            Macabr鼯span> "(dance) of Death" (1376), probably a

            Machab毲um, lit. "dance of the Maccabees"
            (leaders of the Jewish revolt against Syro-Hellenes,
            see Maccabees). The association
            with the dance of death seems to be via vivid
            descriptions of the martyrdom of the Maccabees in the
            Apocryphal books. The abstracted sense of "gruesome" is
            first attested 1842 in French, 1889 in English.

            
              The typical form which the allegory takes is that of
              a series of pictures, sculptured or painted, in which
              Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or as a
              shrunken corpse wrapped in grave-clothes to persons
              representing every age and condition of life, and
              leads them all in a dance to the grave.

          in English well before his works were translated ("The
          Discourses" 1636, "The Prince" 1640), in part because his
          books were Indexed by the Church, in part because of
          French attacks on him (e.g. Gentillet's, translated into
          English 1602).

            influenced by noxious.

            
              Obnoxious has two very different senses, one of which
              (exposed or open or liable to attack or injury) requires
              notice because its currency is now so restricted that
              it is puzzling to the uninstructed. It is the word's
              rightful or de jure
              meaning, and we may hope that scholarly writers will
              keep it alive. [Fowler]

          Rome, where old mystery plays were adapted to religious
          services.
</etymology>
<word>orator</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "one who pleads or

          assembly, plead," from PIE base *or- "to pronounce a ritual

          "they praise," Homeric Gk. are, Attic ara "prayer," Hittite ariya- "to ask the oracle," aruwai- "to revere, worship").

          oordeel, Ger. urteil "judgment"), lit. "that

          to O.E. ad次n "to deal out"
          (see deal). The notion is of the
          kind of arduous physical test (such as walking
          blindfolded and barefoot between red-hot plowshares) that
          was believed to determine a person's guilt or innocence
          by immediate judgment of the deity, an ancient Teutonic
          mode of trial. English retains a more exact sense of the
          word; its cognates in German, etc., have been

          reborrowed 16c. from M.L. or M.Fr., which got it from
          Germanic. Metaphoric extension to "anything which tests
          character or endurance" is attested from 1650s. The
          prefix or- survives in
          English only in this word, but was common in O.E. and
          other Germanic languages (Goth. ur-, O.N. or-, etc.) and was originally an

              common law which ... is committed to the doctrine
              that no sexual activity is justifiable unless its
              objective is procreation. [A.C. Kinsey, et.al., "Sexual Behavior in the Human

          quadrupes (gen. quadrupedis) "four-footed, a
          four-footed animal," from quadri- "four" (see quadri-) + pes "foot" (see foot). The adjective is
          attested from 1741.
</etymology>
<word>quaff</word>	
<etymology>1510s (implied in quaffer), perhaps onomatopoeic, or
          perhaps from Low Ger. quassen "to overindulge (in food

<word>quail</word>	
<etymology>c.1300, quayle, from O.Fr. quaille, perhaps via M.L. quaccula (cf. Prov. calha, It. quaglia, O.Sp. coalla), from a Germanic source
          (cf. O.H.G. quahtala
          "quail," Ger. Wachtel),

          could describe the word itself, which had become rare
          after c.1700 (though it soon recovered popularity in this
          secondary sense). Chaucer used quaint and queynte as spellings of cunt in "Canterbury Tales"
          (c.1386), and Andrew Marvell may be punning on it
          similarly in "To His Coy Mistress" (1650).

          for 40 days," from L. quadraginta "forty," related to
          quattuor "four" (see four). Sense of "period a ship

          1660s, from It. quarantina
          giorni, lit. "space of forty days," from quaranta "forty," from L. quadraginta. So called from the

<word>queasy</word>	
<etymology>mid-15c., coysy, possibly from O.N. kveisa "boil," perhaps influenced
          by Anglo-Fr. queisier, from
          O.Fr. coisier "to wound,
          hurt, make uneasy," from the same Germanic root as kveisa. But history is obscure and
          evidences of development are wanting.
</etymology>
<word>quell</word>	
<etymology>O.E. cwellan "to kill, murder,
          execute," from P.Gmc. *kwaljanan (cf. O.E. cwelan "to die," cwalu "violent death;" O.S. quellian "to torture, kill;" O.N.
          kvelja "to torment;" M.Du.

</etymology>
<word>query</word>	
<etymology>1530s, quaere, from L. quaere "ask," imperative of quaerere "to seek, gain, ask,"
          probably ultimately from PIE *kwo-, base forming the stem of
          relative and interrogative pronouns. Spelling altered
          c.1600 by influence of inquiry. The noun in the sense of
          "a question" is attested from 1630s.
</etymology>
<word>queue</word>	
<etymology>15c., "tail of a beast" (heraldic
          term), from Fr. queue "a
          tail," from O.Fr. cue
          "tail," from L. coda
          (dialectal variant of cauda)
          "tail," of unknown origin. The M.E. metaphoric extension
          to "line of dancers" led to extended sense of "line of
          people, etc." (1837). Also used 18c. in sense of "braid
          of hair" (first attested 1748). The verb meaning "to
          stand in a line" is recorded from 1927 (implied in queuing). Churchill is said to

<word>quibble</word>	
<etymology>1610s, "a pun, a play on words,"

          "evasion of point at issue" (c.1550), from L. quibus "by what (things)?," dative
          and ablative plural of quid
          "what," neut. of quis (see
          who). The word's overuse in
          legal jargon supposedly gave it the association with
          trivial argument. Meaning "equivocation, evasion of the
          point" is attested from 1660s. The verb in this sense is
          from 1650s. Related: Quibbled; quibbling.

<etymology>early 15c., in ancient and medieval
          philosophy, "pure essence, substance of which the
          heavenly bodies are composed," lit. "fifth essence," from
          M.Fr. quinte essence (14c.),
          from M.L. quinta essentia,
          from L. quinta, fem. of
          quintus "fifth" + essentia (see essence). Loan-translation of
          Gk. pempte ousia, the
          "ether" added by Aristotle to the four known elements
          (water, earth, fire, air) and said to permeate all
          things. Its extraction was one of the chief goals of
          alchemy. Sense of "purest essence" (of a situation,
          character, etc.) is first recorded 1580s.

</etymology>
<word>quirk</word>	
<etymology>1560s, "quibble, evasion," of
          unknown origin, perhaps connected to Ger. quer (see queer) via notion of twisting
          and slanting; but its earliest appearance in western
          England dialect seems to argue against this source.
          Perhaps originally a technical term for a twist or
          flourish in weaving. Sense of "peculiarity" is
          c.1600.
</etymology>
<word>quisling</word>

          romen "to walk, go" (see roam), perhaps via romblen (late 14c.) "to ramble."
          The vowel change perhaps by influence of M.Du. rammelen, a derivative of rammen "copulate," "used of the

          probably from an unrelated Scandinavian word (cf.

          party with loud, fast electronic music and often

<word>ruffian</word>	
<etymology>1530s, from M.Fr. rufian "a pimp," from It. ruffiano "a pander, pimp," of

          unidentified source that also produced similar words in
          O.Prov., Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Basque.
          In French, the sense of "deliberately and maliciously
          destroying property" originally was in reference to labor
          disputes, but the oft-repeated story that the modern
          meaning derives from strikers' supposed tactic of
          throwing old shoes into machinery is not supported by the
          etymology. Likely it was not meant as a literal image;
          the word was used in French in a variety of "bungling"
          senses, such as "to play a piece of music badly." The
          verb is first attested 1918 in English, from the noun.
          Saboteur is 1921, a
          borrowing of the French agent noun. Related: Sabotaged; sabotaging.

          ordaining," also "decree, ordinance," from sanctus, pp. of sancire "to decree, confirm,
          ratify, make sacred" (see saint). Originally especially
          of ecclesiastical decrees. The verb sense of "to permit
          authoritatively" is from 1797. Related: Sanctioned; sanctioning.

<word>sanctuary</word>	
<etymology>mid-14c., "building set apart for
          holy worship," from Anglo-Fr. sentuarie, from O.Fr. sainctuarie, from L.L. sanctuarium "a sacred place,
          shrine" (especially the Hebrew Holy of Holies; see sanctum), also "a private
          room," from L. sanctus
          "holy" (see saint). By medieval Church
          law, fugitives or debtors enjoyed immunity from arrest in
          churches, hence transferred sense of "immunity from
          punishment" (late 14c.). General (non-ecclesiastical)
          sense of "place of refuge or protection" is attested from
          1560s; as "land set aside for wild plants or animals to
          breed and live" it is recorded from 1879. Under English
          law, one claiming the right of
          sanctuary had 40 days to confess and accept
          permanent banishment. This was abolished in Britain 1625
          in criminal cases, 1696, 1722 in civil cases.

<word>sanguinary</word>	
<etymology>"characterized by slaughter,"
          1620s, possibly from Fr. sanguinaire, or directly from L.
          sanguinarius "pertaining to
          blood," from sanguis (gen.
          sanguinis) "blood," of
          unknown origin. L. distinguished sanguis, the generic word, from
          cruor "blood from a wound."
          The latter word is related to Gk. kreas "meat," Skt. kravis- "raw flesh," O.E. hreaw- "raw" (see raw).

<word>sanguine</word>	
<etymology>early 14c., "type of red cloth,"

          "bloody, bloodthirsty," from sanguis (gen. sanguinis) "blood" (see sanguinary). Meaning
          "blood-red" is recorded from late 14c. Meaning "cheerful,
          hopeful, confident" first attested c.1500, since these
          qualities were thought in medieval physiology to spring
          from an excess of blood as one of the four humors.
</etymology>
<word>sardonic</word>	
<etymology>1630s, from Fr. sardonique (16c.), from L. sardonius (but as if from L. *sardonicus) in Sardonius risus, loan-translation
          of Gk. sardonios (gelos) "of
          bitter or scornful (laughter)," altered from Homeric
          sardanios (of uncertain
          origin) by influence of Sardonios "Sardinian," because the
          Greeks believed that eating a certain plant they called
          sardonion (lit. "plant from
          Sardinia," see Sardinia) caused facial
          convulsions resembling those of sardonic laughter,
          usually followed by death. For nuances of usage, see humor. Related: Sardonically.

<word>sartorial</word>	
<etymology>"pertaining to a tailor," 1823,

          L.L. sartor "tailor," lit.
          "patcher, mender," from L. sart-, pp. stem of sarcire "to patch, mend." Sartorius as the name of the long
          leg muscle is because it is used in crossing the legs to
          bring them into the position needed to sit like a tailor.
          Related: Sartorially.

<word>satellite</word>	
<etymology>1540s, "follower or attendant of a

          from Etruscan satnal
          (Klein), or a compound of roots *satro- "full, enough" + *leit- "to go" (Tucker); cf.
          English follow, which is
          constructed of similar roots. Meaning "planet that
          revolves about a larger one" first attested 1660s, in
          reference to the moons of Jupiter, from L. satellites, which was used in this
          sense 1610s by German astronomer Johannes Kepler
          (1571-1630). Galileo, who had discovered them, called
          them Sidera Medic桼/span> in
          honor of the Medici family. Meaning "man-made machinery
          orbiting the Earth" first recorded 1936 as theory, 1957
          as fact. Meaning "country dependent and subservient to
          another" is recorded from 1800.

          Saturn," from M.E. Saturne
          (see Saturn). Medieval physiology
          believed these characteristics to be caused by the
          astrological influence of the planet Saturn, which was
          the most remote from the Sun (in the limited knowledge of

<word>saunter</word>	
<etymology>late 15c., santren "to muse, be in reverie,"
          of uncertain origin. Meaning "walk with a leisurely gait"
          is from 1660s, and may be a different word entirely. Some
          suggest this word derives via Anglo-Fr. sauntrer (mid-14c.) from Fr. s'aventurer "to take risks," but
          OED finds this "unlikely." The noun meaning "a leisurely
          stroll" is recorded from 1828. Related: Sauntered; sauntering.

          sense seems to be of half of a bivalve ("split") shell
          used as a drinking cup or a pan for weighing. But
          according to Paulus Diaconus the "drinking cup" sense
          originated from a supposed custom of making goblets from
          skulls (see skull).

<word>scapegoat</word>	
<etymology>
            1530, "goat sent into the wilderness on the Day of
            Atonement, symbolic bearer of the sins of the people,"
            coined by Tyndale from scape (n.) + goat to translate L. caper emissarius, itself a
            translation in Vulgate of Heb. 'azazel (Lev. xvi:8,10,26),
            which was read as 'ez ozel
            "goat that departs," but which others hold to be the
            proper name of a devil or demon in Jewish mythology
            (sometimes identified with Canaanite deity Aziz). Jerome's reading also was
            followed by Martin Luther (der
            ledige Bock), Symmachus (tragos aperkhomenos), and others
            (cf. Fr. bouc 魩ssaire),
            but the question of who, or what (or even where) is
            meant by 'azazel is a
            vexed one. The Revised Version (1884) simply restores
            Azazel. But the old
            translation has its modern defenders: 

            
              Azazel is an active
              participle or participial noun, derived ultimately
              from azal (connected
              with the Arabic word azala, and meaning removed),
              but immediately from the reduplicate form of that
              verb, azazal. The
              reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew
              and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that
              while azal means
              removed, azalzal means
              removed by a repetition of acts. Azalzel or azazel, therefore, means one
              who removes by a series of acts. ... The
              interpretation is founded on sound etymological
              grounds, it suits the context wherever the word
              occurs, it is consistent with the remaining
              ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords
              with the otherwise known religious beliefs and
              symbolical practices of the Israelites. [Rev. F.
              Meyrick, "Leviticus," London, 1882]
            
            Meaning "one who is blamed or punished for the mistakes
            or sins of others" first recorded 1824; the verb is
            attested from 1943.

          "mockery," M.Dan. skof
          "jest, mockery;" perhaps from P.Gmc. *skub-, *skuf- (cf. O.E. scop "poet," O.H.G. scoph "fiction, sport, jest,

<word>scotch</word>	
<etymology>"of Scotland," 1590s, contraction
          of Scottish. Disdained by the
          Scottish because of the many insulting and pejorative
          formations made from it by the English (e.g. Scotch attorney, a Jamaica term
          from 1864 for strangler vines). As a noun, elliptical for
          Scotch whisky, it is
          attested from 1778. Scotch-Irish is from 1876; more
          properly Scots-Irish (1972),
          from Scots (mid-14c.), the
          older adj., which is from Scottis, the northern variant of
          Scottish. Scotch Tape was said to be so
          called because at first it had adhesive only on the edges
          (to make it easier to remove as a masking tape in car
          paint jobs), which was interpreted as a sign of cheapness
          on the part of the manufacturers.
</etymology>
<word>scourge</word>	
<etymology>early 13c., from Anglo-Fr. escorge, back-formation from O.Fr.

          ex- "out, off" + corrigia "thong, shoelace," in
          this case "whip," probably from a Gaulish word related to
          O.Ir. cuimrech "fetter." The
          verb is attested from early 13c. Scourge of God, title given by
          later generations to Attila the Hun (406–453 C.E.), is
          attested from late 14c., from L. flagellum Dei.

          belly," from schoren "to
          lacerate" + M.L.G. buk, Du.

<word>shambles</word>	
<etymology>late 15c., "meat or fish market,"
          from schamil "table, stall
          for vending" (c.1300), from O.E. scomul, sceamel "stool, footstool,

          skamel, M.Du. schamel, O.H.G. scamel, Ger. schemel) from L. scamillus "low stool," ultimately
          a dim. of scamnum "stool,
          bench," from PIE base *skabh- "to prop up, support." In
          English, sense evolved to "slaughterhouse" (1540s),

<word>sham</word>	
<etymology>1670s, "a trick, a hoax, a fraud,"
          perhaps from sham, a

          from 1728. The meaning in pillow-sham (1721) is from the
          notion of "counterfeit." The adj. is attested from 1680s;
          the verb from 1670s. Related: Shammed; shamming. Shamateur "amateur sportsman who
          acts like a professional" is from 1896.

</etymology>
<word>singular</word>	
<etymology>mid-14c., “singleness of aim or

          from L.L. singularitas, from
          singularis (see singular). Meaning “fact of
          being different from others” is c.1500. Mathematical
          sense of “point at which a function takes an infinite
          value” is from 1893. Astronomical use is from
          1965.

<word>sinister</word>	
<etymology>early 15c., "prompted by malice or
          ill-will," from O.Fr. sinistre "contrary, unfavorable,
          to the left," from L. sinister "left, on the left side"
          (opposite of dexter),
          perhaps from base *sen- and
          meaning prop. "the slower or weaker hand" [Tucker], but
          Buck suggests it's a euphemism (see left), connected with the root
          of Skt. saniyan "more
          useful, more advantageous." The L. word was used in
          augury in the sense of "unlucky, unfavorable" (omens,
          especially bird flights, seen on the left hand were
          regarded as portending misfortune), and thus sinister acquired a sense of
          "harmful, unfavorable, adverse." This was from Greek
          influence, reflecting the early Greek practice of facing
          north when observing omens; in genuine Roman auspices,
          the left was favorable. Bend
          (not "bar") sinister in heraldry indicates
          illegitimacy and preserves the lit. sense of "on the left
          side."

            B.C.E.), from skeptesthai
            "to reflect, look, view" (see scope (1)). The extended

          believed to have come from Prussia.

<word>stalemate</word>	
<etymology>1765, in chess, from stale "stalemate" (early 15c.) +
          mate "checkmate" (see checkmate). M.E. stale is probably from Anglo-Fr.
          estale "standstill" (see stall (2)). A misnomer, since
          a stale is not a mate. "In England from the 17th c.
          to the beginning of the 19th c. the player who received
          stalemate won the game" [OED]. Figurative sense is

          1726 (originally plural), from earlier meaning
          "congenital vital capacities of a person or animal," also
          in part from Latin application to the threads spun by the
          Fates to determine the length and course of one's life,
          and partly from a figurative use of L. stamen "the warp (of cloth)" on

<etymology>1530s (in L. form sycophanta), "informer,
          talebearer, slanderer," from L. sycophanta, from Gk. sykophantes, originally "one who
          shows the fig," from sykon
          "fig" + phanein "to show."
          "Showing the fig" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking
          the thumb between two fingers, a display which vaguely
          resembles a fig, itself symbolic of a cunt (sykon also meant "vulva"). The
          story goes that prominent politicians in ancient Greece
          held aloof from such inflammatory gestures, but privately
          urged their followers to taunt their opponents. The sense
          of "mean, servile flatterer" is first recorded in English
          1570s.

          forest, grove," of unknown origin. Adjective meaning "of
          the woods" is attested from 1570s. Silvanus was used by the Romans as
          the proper name of a god of woods and fields, identified
          with Pan. Spelling with -y-

<etymology>1734, from Fr. vampire or Ger. Vampir (1732, in an account of
          Hungarian vampires), from Hung. vampir, from O.C.S. opiri (cf. Serb. vampir, Bulg. vapir, Ukrainian uper), said by Slavic linguist
          Franc Miklošič to be ultimtely from Kazan Tatar ubyr "witch," but Max Vasmer, an
          expert in this linguistic area, finds that phonetically
          doubtful. An Eastern European creature popularized in
          English by late 19c. gothic novels, however there are
          scattered English accounts of night-walking,
          blood-gorged, plague-spreading undead corpses from as far

</etymology>
<word>vapid</word>	
<etymology>1650s, "flat, insipid" (of drinks),
          from L. vapidus "flat,
          insipid," lit. "that has exhaled its vapor," related to

          probably to vapor "vapor."
          Applied from 1758 to talk and writing deemed dull and
          lifeless.
</etymology>
<word>vaporize</word>	
<etymology>1630s, from vapor + -ize. Originally "smoke

</etymology>
<word>variegated</word>	
<etymology>early 13c., from O.Fr. peinter, from peint, pp. of peindre "to paint," from L. pingere "to paint," from PIE base
          *pik-/*pig- "cut." Sense
          evolution between PIE and Latin was, presumably, from
          "decorate with cut marks" to "decorate" to "decorate with
          color." Cf. Skt. pingah
          "reddish," pesalah "adorned,
          decorated, lovely," pimsati
          "hews out, cuts, carves, adorns;" O.C.S. pegu "variegated;" Gk. poikilos "variegated;" O.H.G.
          fehjan "to adorn;" O.C.S.
          pisati, Lith. piesiu "to write." Probably
          representing the "cutting" branch of the family are O.E.
          feol (see file (n.)); O.C.S. pila "file, saw," Lith. pela "file."
          
          The noun is from c.1600. The verb meaning "to color with
          paint" (mid-13c.) is earlier than the artistic sense of
          "to make a picture of" (late 13c.) and older than painting in the sense of "an
          artist's picture in paint" (late 14c.); but painter is older in the sense of
          "artist who paints pictures" (mid-14c.) than in the sense
          of "workman who colors surfaces with paint" (c.1400). To
          paint the town (red) "go on
          a spree" first recorded 1884; to paint (someone or something) black
          "represent it as wicked or evil" is from 1590s. Adj.
          paint-by-numbers "simple" is
          attested by 1970; the art-for-beginners kits themselves
          date to c.1953.

</etymology>
<word>veer</word>	
<etymology>1580s, "to change direction"

</etymology>
<word>vegetate</word>	
<etymology>c.1600, "to grow as plants do,"

</etymology>
<word>vehement</word>

          L. vehementem (nom. vehemens) "impetuous, carried
          away," perhaps from a lost present middle participle of
          vehere "to carry" (see vehicle). The other theory is
          that it represents vehe-
          "lacking, wanting" + mens
          "mind." Related: Vehemently.
</etymology>
<word>velocity</word>	
<etymology>1550a, from L. velocitatem (nom. velocitas) "swiftness, speed,"

            manliness, valor, excellence, worth," from vir "man" (see virile). Phrase by virtue of (early 13c.)
            preserves alternative M.E. sense of "efficacy." Wyclif
            Bible has virtue where
            K.J.V. uses power. The
            seven cardinal virtues
            (early 14c.) were divided into the natural (justice,
            prudence, temperance, fortitude) and the theological

            facere de necessitate
            virtutem [Jerome]. 

            
              For my part I honour with the name of virtue the
              habit of acting in a way troublesome to oneself and
              useful to others. [Stendhal "de

          from PIE *weip- "to turn,

          vok, vaka "hole in the ice,"
          from P.Gmc. *wakwo. The
          sense perhaps evolved via "track made by a vessel through
          ice." Perhaps the English word is directly from

            lit. "to pull, draw," from P.Gmc. *teuhan (cf. O.H.G. ziohan "to pull;" see tug). The basic notion
            perhaps is "ill-bred, poorly brought up;" cf. Ger.

            haughty," lit. "unpulled."

              kill vs for their sport. [Shakespeare, "Lear," 1605]
            
            Noun sense of "lascivious, lewd person" is attested
            from 1520s. The verb is recorded from 1580s. The only
            English survival of a once-common Germanic negating
            prefix still active in Dutch (cf. wanbestuur "misgovernment,"
            wanluid "discordant

<word>warranted</word>	
<etymology>mid-13c., "seizure and occupation

          anticipation," from praesumere "to take beforehand,"
          from prae "before" (see pre-) + sumere "to take" (see exempt). In English, the

</etymology>
<word>warren</word>	
<etymology>late 14c., "piece of land enclosed
          for breeding beasts and fowls," from Anglo-Fr. and

          Gaulish *varenna "enclosed
          area," related to *varros
          "post." Or the O.Fr. forms may derive from the prp. of

          from the Gmc. root *war- "to
          protect, guard" (source of O.E. warian "take care;" see warrant (n.)). Later esp.
          "piece of land for breeding of rabbits" (c.1400), which

          for "weather" until kairos
          (lit. "time") began to be used as such in Byzantine
          times. L. tempestas
          "weather" (see tempest) also originally meant
          "time;" and words for "time" also came to mean weather in
          Irish (aimsir),
